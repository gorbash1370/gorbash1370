# My Repos

Hobby-coding for only about 6 months at the start of 2024, my GitHub is a "Learning in Public" endeavour, hosting my practice projects.   

If anyone happens to find my small scripts useful, great!

Hopefully over time my work will attest to an increase in sophistication!

# Projects

Coming Soon! 

# Collab

Having benefited greatly from the generous sharing by others of their skills and output, I'm really passionate about the Open Source philosophy and hope to contribute meaningfully to the community. 

This profile is deliberately explicit about my experience and stage in the learning journey: if anyone has a project I could work on, wants to collab or is interested in mentoring, please do reach out! 

Constructive criticism on my work is always welcome.
